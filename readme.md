**Izanami** is a shared configuration service well-suited for micro-service architecture implementation. In addition to shared configuration, Izanami provides feature flipping and A/B Testing. Izanami provides a UI to allow non-tech users to toggle features and to handle A/B testing.

**Izanami** also provides first class integration. We provide Java, Scala, Node and React clients to integrate with your apps. We also provide webhook integration.

**Izanami** is written in [scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) using the [playframework](https://www.playframework.com/) and developed by the <a href="https://maif.github.io" target="_blank">MAIF OSS</a> team.
