# Philosophy

Every OSS product build at <a href="https://www.maif.fr/" target="_blank">MAIF</a> like <a href="https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/" target="_blank">Otoroshi</a> follow a common philosophy. 

* The services or API provided should be technology agnostic.
* HTTP first: HTTP is the right answer to the previous quote   
* API First: The UI is just another client of the API. 
* Secured: The services exposed need authentication for both humans and machines  
* Event based: The services should expose a way to get notified of what happened inside.
