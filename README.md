Izanami is an open source centralized feature flag solution.

Feature flags are a software development pattern that allows turning a feature on or off without needing to modify or redeploy an application.

Feature flags typically allow implementation of canary release, progressive rollout, A/B testing or even "panic buttons".

Izanami is a centralized feature flag solution, which allows sharing flags between applications, having a fine-tuned right management and keeping a log of who modify or request flags.
