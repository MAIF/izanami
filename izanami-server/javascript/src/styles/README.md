# About this folder
The styles folder is there for legacy reasons.
In Version 1.x of react-webpack-template, it would hold all stylesheets for your given project, including styles via an alias in the webpack configuration.
This was deprecated for 2.x.

If you do not plan to use global styles, you may savely remove this folder.
