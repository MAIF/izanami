Sometimes it's helpful to see what happened to a flag to understand why a feature was activated / deactivated.

To help diagnose such cases, Izanami offers an audit log on projects. Each user action that modifies a feature activation strategy (update, deletion, reimport,...) creates an entry in this log.

<Note>Audit log for features are available from Izanmi 2.7.0</Note>


# Project audit log

Project "log" view displays all actions made on this project features.

<img src={logTable} />

For "Created" and "Updated" events, details can be seen by using the row action button.

<img src={naturalLanguage} />

Details can either be displayed in natural language (as above) or in JSON format (see below).

<img src={jsonDiff} />

Page top section allows filtering displayed actions based on several criteria, such as action type, user, feature, ...

<img src={searchForm} />

<Note>
When using search, current criteria will be stored in URL.<br/>
Therefore, you can easily share search results by sharing the current URL.
</Note>

You can search actions concerning deleting users / flags by typing their usernames / IDs directly in search form selects.

## Log retention

Audit log retention duration is configured by the [app.audit.events-hours-ttl parameter](./configuration#audit) parameter.
Event older that indicated retention will be discarded and therefore won't be visible from audit log pages.
