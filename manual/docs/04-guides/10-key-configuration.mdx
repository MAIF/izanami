API keys allow client application to call Izanami endpoints.

Keys are either accredited to a list of projects, or declared admin.

Admin keys can access every project for their tenants.

To create a new key, you must have write authorization on tenant.

Go to the "Key" menu, and click on "Create new key" button.

<img src={keyEmptyForm} />

In this form, you must indicate a name for the new key, you can also specify whether it's an admin key or specify accredited projects for this key.

<img src={keyFilledForm} />

Once your key is created, a modal is displayed that indicate client id and client secret.

**Make sure you copy client secret**, once the modal is closed it won't be displayed again.

<img src={keyModal} />

Once your api key is created, you can use it to query Izanami, by passing two headers :

- `Izanami-Client-Id` : client id of your key
- `Izanami-Client-Secret` : client secret of your key
