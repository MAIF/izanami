Embedding local script features in Izanami allows to leverage the power and flexibility of script features without needing to deploy a WASMO instance in production.\_createMdxContent

This strategy implies that you'll be on your own to handle plugins versions and lifecycle, though [wasmo-CLI](https://github.com/MAIF/wasmo/tree/main/cli) could help with this.

<Note>
  Since this method requires embedding Base64 encoded WASM scripts in Izanami
  database, it's recommended to use languages that produce lightweight WASM
  files, such as `go` or `OPA`.
</Note>

## Creating your script with WASMO cli

In this example, we'll create a script feature that returns true if request context contains "mobile".

We want this feature to be active for following contexts :

- `prod/mobile`
- `mobile`
- `dev/mobile`
- `mobile`
- ...

and to be inactive for following contexts :

- `prod`
- `dev`
- empty context
- ...

First you'll need to [install WASMO CLI](https://github.com/MAIF/wasmo/tree/main/cli#installation).

Then instantiate a new project.
Wasmo provide some built-in templates, we'll be using the `Izanami opa` one for this example.
You'll need to open a command shell for this.

```sh
wasmo init --name=izanami-mobile --template=izanami_opa
```

<Note>
  If you want to use go instead of opa for this tutorial, simply replace
  `izanami_opa` with `izanami_go`.
</Note>

This command should create a `izanami-mobile` directory where you run it.
This directory should contain two files : `main.go` and `go.mod`.

For our feature, we'll only need to modify `main.go` with the following code:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="opa"
  values={[
    { label: "Open Policy Agent (OPA)", value: "opa" },
    { label: "Go", value: "go" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="opa">

```rego
package example
import rego.v1

default can_access = false

can_access if {
  some x in input.executionContext
  x == "mobile"
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go">
<div>

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/extism/go-pdk"
  "slices"
)

type Input struct {
  ExecutionContext []string `json:"executionContext"`
}

type Output struct {
  Active bool `json:"active"`
}

//export execute
func execute() int32 {
  input := Input{}
  _ = pdk.InputJSON(&input)

  active := slices.Contains(input.ExecutionContext, "mobile")

  output := Output{active}
  _ = pdk.OutputJSON(&output)
  return 0
}

func main() {}
```

This code may seem obscure at first, however it does a quite basic task :

1.  It reads `executionContext` fields provided by Izanami, that indicates the context that was used for querying Izanami.
2.  It checks if `mobile` contexts is present somewhere in context path
3.  It writes the result within the `active` field of the output

  </div>
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

As you can see, Open Policy Agent is arguably best suited for this kind of script.

Once you're done editing the file, build your script with the following command :

```sh
wasmo build --host=OneShotDocker --path=izanami-mobile
```

This will generate an `izanami-mobile-1.0.0.wasm` file at the root of your directory.

You can now convert this file to base64, for instance, with the following command :

```sh
openssl base64 -A -in ./izanami-mobile/izanami-mobile-1.0.0.wasm -out out.txt
```

<Note>
  Izanami requires base64 to be on a single line, that's why we use the `-A`
  flag in the above command.
</Note>

Once you've got your Base64 script, you'll need to create a WASM Base64 feature in Izanami.

To do this, select "New WASM script" feature type, then indicate that WASM script is of type "Base64".
Then you'll need to paste your base64 WASM script in the appropriate input.

<img src={filledFeatureForm} />

Once your feature is created, we can test it.
Let's first see if it works with a basic `mobile` context.

<img src={activeMobile} />

Our script also works with subcontext containing a `mobile` subcontext.

<img src={activeProdMobile} />

As expected, it does not activate feature for a context that does not contain `mobile`.

<img src={inactiveProd} />
