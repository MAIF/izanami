To invite new users, you must be an Izanami admin.

You can invite new user from the global "Users" page.

<img src={emptyInvitationForm} />

In this form, you must indicate email of the user to invite.

You can also specify user rights (it could be done later).

<img src={filledInvitationForm} />

Once the invitation is sent, Izanami will either display the invitation link or send it to the specified email, based on [your configuration](./mailer-configuration).

If invitation mode is set to "Request response", Izanami will display the invitation url **so that you can send it to the concerned user**.

The strong point of this mode is that it doesn't require any mailer configuration.

<img src={invitationUrl} />

<Note>
  Make sure that you __copy url before closing this modal__, it won't be
  displayed again.
</Note>

Your new user must open the link to define its username and password.

<img src={newUserForm} />

Once this form is validated, new user can log in !
