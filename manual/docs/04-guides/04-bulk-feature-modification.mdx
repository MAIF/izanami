Izanami allows enabling / disable or delete multiple features at once.

This is useful when you want a set of feature to be enabled / disabled at once, or simply to avoid too many clicks.

First, you need to select row of every feature that need modification.

<img src={selectedRows} />

Then click on the "Bulk action" select above table.

<img src={actionMenu} />

Once "Enable" is selected, click "Enable X features" button.

<img src={buttonHover} />

And that's it, your features are now enabled.

<img src={finalState} />
