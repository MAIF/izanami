Contexts allow to define a different behavior / value for your flags. It can be usefull to handle environments.
To learn more about contexts, read the [context guide](./env-contexts).

It is sometimes usefull to "protect" contexts to avoid accidental modifications,
for instance to avoir updating a flag activation in production by mistake.

For such cases, Izanami allows to "protect" a context.

## Rights on protected contexts

Operation on protected contexts are restricted to users with *admin* rights on either project or tenant, depending if context is local or global.

Protected contexts and associated overloads remain visible to any user with read right on project / tenant.

### Global contexts

Below array details right change regarding global protected contexts.

## Protecting a context

To protect a context, you'll have to go to context page, either global context page (for global contexts) or project context page (for local contexts).

Then click on the "3 dots" icons and choose "protect context" option.

<img src={protectContext} />

Once you've confirmed, context is protected.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ When protecting a context all subcontexts automatically get protected as well. ⚠️⚠️⚠️


## Unprotecting a context

As for protecting context, you'll have to go to context page (project context page for local context, tenant context page for global context).

Then click on the "3 dots" icons and choose "unprotect context" option.

<img src={unprotectContext} />

Once you've confirmed, context is unprotected.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ Unlike context protection, unprotecting context DOES NOT unprotect subcontexts. ⚠️⚠️⚠️
