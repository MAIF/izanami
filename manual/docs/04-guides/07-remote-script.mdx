To use remote script feature (in opposition to local script features, [that we've seen previously](./06-local-scripts.mdx)), you'll need to instantiate WASMO in alongside Izanami.

Moreover, you'll need to [set up Izanami connection to WASMO](./configuration#wasmo).

Using remote WASMO instance allows leveraging its capabilities regarding script editions and lifecycle.
Of course, this implies to instantiate and supervise an additional application.

First, let's create our plugin in WASMO, for this example, we will create an Izanami js plugin.

<img src={pluginTemplate} />

Let's name it `mobile`.

<img src={pluginName} />

We'll one again create a script that returns `true` if `mobile` is one of request contexts, and `false` otherwise. Let's paste following code in WASMO editor :

```js
export function execute() {
  let input = JSON.parse(Host.inputString());
  Host.outputString(
    JSON.stringify({
      active: input.executionContext.includes("mobile"),
    })
  );

  return 0;
}
```

<img src={wasmoPluginFilled} />

Then click the build button (top right) to build our `mobile` script.

<img src={pluginBuilded} />

Now let's get back to Izanami and create a new WASM feature. This time we'll choose to create a `WASMO` feature.

<img src={pluginFormFilled} />

Once again, let's test our feature, it should be active for `mobile` context.

<img src={mobileActive} />

It should also be active for `prod/mobile` subcontext.

<img src={prodMobileActive} />

And of course it should be inactive for `prod` context.

<img src={prodInactive} />
