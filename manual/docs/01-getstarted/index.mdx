# Get started

This guide will help you to:

1. Get your first Izanami instance up and running
2. Creating your first feature
3. Requesting features through HTTP

To cover more advanced topics, either read about [core concepts](../concepts) or [our guides](../guides/).

## Instantiate Izanami locally

There are several ways to start Izanami.

### Using docker

One solution si to run a postgres DB separately (change `IZANAMI_PG_URI` to match your database setting).

```sh
docker run --env IZANAMI_PG_URI=postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres -p 9000:9000 izanami
```

Alternatively, you can run following docker-compose file

```yml
# Use postgres/example user/password credentials
version: '3.1'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
  izanami:
    image: maif/izanami:2.0.0
    environment:
      IZANAMI_PG_URI: postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres
    ports:
      - 9000:9000
```

### Using Java

You'll need to run a postgres database to start Izanami. Replace `app.pg.uri` with your database values.

```sh
java -jar \
  -Dapp.pg.uri=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres \
  izanami.jar
```

## Your first feature

### Creating tenant and project

Before creating a feature, you need to create a tenant and a project.

These two organizations levels will help you to keep thing organized

When login in for the first time, Izanami will ask you to create a tenant.

<img src={emptyLandingPage} />

When clicking this button, Izanami will display tenant creation form, tenant name can contain:

- lowercase letters
- numbers
- `-` and `_` characters

<img src={tenanForm} />

Once tenant is created, Izanami redirects you its page, and indicates that there is no project for this tenant yet.

<img src={firstTenant} />

On this screen there are two choices, we can either create a new project from scratch or import data, for this guide we will create a new project.
If you're interested in importing data, check the [data importing guide](../guides/import-from-v1).

After clicking the creation button, a form is displayed. Project name can contain following symbols :

- letters (uppercase or lowercase)
- numbers
- `-` and `_` characters

<img src={projectForm} />

After validating this form, Izanami once again redirects you, this time on the new project page.

<img src={firstProject} />

### Create your first feature

Now that we have a project, let's create our first feature. Just click on the "Create new feature" button.

In this form, feature name can contain following symbols:

- letters (uppercase or lowercase)
- numbers
- `-`, `_` and `:` characters

For now, we'll keep feature as simple as possible: feature will be either active or inactive for everyone.

Check "Enabled" checkbox if you want your feature to be active, let it unchecked otherwise.

<img src={featureForm} />

After saving this new feature, our project doesn't look that empty anymore.

<img src={firstFeature} />

### Test your feature locally

Izanami allows to test feature from backoffice. Click on action icon at the end of your feature row.

<img src={testMenu} />

Now click on "Test Feature" item to display test form.

<img src={testForm} />

This form allows to specify several query parameters, but we don't need it right now, just click on the test button.

A result textbox will appear indicating if feature is currently active or not.

<img src={featureResult} />

## Querying your feature

To query feature state from external application, we'll need to create a client key.

<Note>We recommand to create one key by client application</Note>

### Creating an API key

First let's go to the API key screen, click on "Keys" entry of left menu.

<img src={keyScreen} />

Click on "Create new key" to display key creation form. Key name can contain following symbols:

- letters (uppercase or lowercase)
- numbers
- `-` and `_` characters

You'll also need to select allowed projects in select. Alternatively, you can check "admin" checkbox.

<Note>Admin keys have right on all tenant projects</Note>

<img src={keyForm} />

Once your key is created, a popup will display associated client id and secret.

<img src={keySecret} />

### Retrieving request URL

To retrieve feature call URL, you'll need to get back to your project.
To do this click on "Projects" item on left menu, and then click on your project.

Once you are back on your project screen, click on the link icon on your feature row.

<img src={urlScreen} />

Click the "copy" button to copy feature URL.

<Note>
  Izanami is using technical ID in URL. The reason it's not using feature name
  is to allow changing feature names without breaking client calls
</Note>

### Requesting using curl

You've got everything you need to query your feature from curl.

<Curl />
