title: Rights

import { Note } from "@site/src/components/Note";

## General principle

Izanami allows to assign specific rights to user on 4 entities :

* tenants
* projects
* keys
* webhooks

There is 3 levels of rights (except for project that offers a 4th level), that generally work like this:

* `Read` right makes an entity visible in Izanami, but doesn't allow any update on it
* `Write` right makes an entity updatable in Izanami, this means modifying its properties
but also create sub-entities inside (for instance write right on a tenant allows create project/keys/webhooks in it).
`Write` right doesn't allow you to delete the entity (write right on tenant doesn't allow to delete it).
* `Admin` right gives the right to do anything possible with the entity, including deleting it.


These 3 rights are hierarchical, `Admin` rigth also includes `Write` and `Read` rights and `Write` right includes `Read` right.

Finally, a user may be global admin, which gives him admin rights on everything and allows to manager Izanami instance option (such as mailer configuration, oidc provider, ...).

### Project

Projects have a special 4th kind of right: `Update`. This right allows to update existing features inside project,
but does not allow creating or deleting features in this project.

## Default rights

Default rights allow to give a user a right that will be used **if he doesn't have any right on an entity**.
For instance, a user with a default project right of `Read` on a tenant will have read right on any project of this tenant, 
except the ones on which he has specific right.

This is a good policy to avoid spending to much time updating rights by hand.

There is 3 types of default rights: projects, keys and webhooks.

## Deducing rights from external authentication provider

Izanami allows the attribution of rights to users coming from external authentication provider.

This allows go give a base set of rights / default rights to any user coming from this provider, 
but also to add specific rights to user with certain roles.
