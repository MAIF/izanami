Izanami offers two way of requesting feature activation status.

- HTTP endpoints: a universal way to call Izanami from any technology that has HTTP client
- Specific clients: these clients wrap calls on HTTP endpoints, providing additional cache and local evaluation mechanisms to minimize latency

Anyway, you'll need to generate a key first.

## Keys

A key is required to call client endpoints. We recommand to use one key per client application. This way client calls are easier to identify.

If key is an admin key, it can read activation status for any feature of the tenant.

If key is not an admin key, you'll have to specify a list of allowed projects. Key will only be able to read activation status for these project features.

When creating a key, Izanami will generate a client id and a client secret for you, they should be passed as `Izanami-Client-Id` and `Izanami-Client-Secret` headers when calling Izanami.

## HTTP(s) endpoints

Izanami exposes two endpoints to fetch feature activation status. One allows to fetch a single feature while the other allows to fetch a list of features.

Both endpoints require following headers:

- `Izanami-Client-Id` key cliend id
- `Izanami-Client-Secret` key client secret

They also accept following query parameters:

- `user` a `string` indicating user (used by user based conditions and maybe script features)
- `context` a `string` indicating context, if your request target a subcontext, separate contexts with a "/". For instance `context/subcontext/subsubcontext`
- `conditions` a `boolean` indicating whether activation conditions should be returned as well. This is useful for caching conditions on the client and recomputing activation startegy locally.

### Single feature endpoint

GET `<izanami-root>/api/v2/features/<id>`: fetches activation status for feature `id`, result has format:

```json
{
  "active": true/false,
  "name": "<feature name>",
  "project": "<feature's project name>"
}
```

where `active` indicates whether feature is active.

### Multiple feature endpoints

GET `<izanami-root>/api/v2/features` fetches activation features specified by query parameters.

Additionally to previously specified query parameters, this endpoints accept specifics query parameters that indicate features to query

- `features`: feature ids to query, comma-separated (for instance `021aaef4-5f82-4567-bc71-5006cb21db2f,021aaef4-5f82-4567-bc71-5006cb21db2e`)
- `projects`: project ids to query, comma-separated. Every feature of every projects will be queried.

```json
{
  "<id>": {
    "active": false,
    "name": "<feature name>",
    "project": "<feature's project name>"
  },
  "<id2>": {
    "active": false,
    "name": "<feature name>",
    "project": "<feature's project name>"
  },
  "<id3>": {
    "active": false,
    "name": "<feature name>",
    "project": "<feature's project name>"
  }
}
```

### Call feature with payload

For script features, it's possible to add a JSON payload that will be used by the script to decide wether feature should be active or not.

This is done by calling above endpoints with `POST` method instead of `GET`, request body will be passed to script.

## Specific clients

Izanami provides one specific Java client, another one is currently under development for JavaScript.

Please <a href="https://github.com/MAIF/izanami/discussions">open a Github discussion</a> if you need a client for another technology.

### Why use a specific client

Client uses HTTP endpoints described above, but it also take care of some usefull stuff for you.

**Cache**: clients are allowed to define a cache strategy. This strategy can be feature-specific or defined globally. It indicates how long a feature flag should be cached.

**Local evaluation**: instead of retrieving and caching feature status (active or not), client will retrieve the feature activation strategy.
This way, the client can recompute the activation status locally when needed, without calling Izanami server again.
