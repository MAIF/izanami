Izanami provides three ways to organize your features.

- Tenant: Izanami is multi-tenant, therefore one instance can be used for completely different use cases
- Projects: inside one tenant, features are distributed in projects
- Tags: tags can regroup features related to the same topic across projects

## Tenants

Tenants separate unrelated stuff.

It could, for instance, be used to separate organizations / companies on one Izanami instance.

Users are shared between tenants, project, features and tags are not.

User can have 4 level of rights on tenants:

|               | Access tenant | Create project | Create tag | See members | Modify user rights | Invite users | Delete tenant | Create tenant |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| Read          | ✅            | ❌             | ❌         | ❌          | ❌                 | ❌           | ❌            | ❌            |
| Write         | ✅            | ✅             | ✅         | ❌          | ❌                 | ❌           | ❌            | ❌            |
| Admin         | ✅            | ✅             | ✅         | ✅          | ✅                 | ✅           | ✅            | ❌            |
| Izanami Admin | ✅            | ✅             | ✅         | ✅          | ✅                 | ✅           | ✅            | ✅            |

## Projects

Project is a feature container.

It has two main usages:

- group together features related to the same project, topic or software
- manage rights or permissions on this group

User can have 3 level of rights on tenants:

|                      | Access project | Edit feature | Create feature | Delete feature | Modify user rights | Invite users | Update project information | Delete project |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Read                 | ✅             | ❌             | ❌           | ❌             | ❌                 | ❌           | ❌                         | ❌             |
| Update (from 2.10.x) | ✅             | ❌             | ❌           | ❌             | ❌                 | ❌           | ❌                         | ❌             |
| Write                | ✅             | ✅             | ✅           | ✅             | ❌                 | ❌           | ❌                         | ❌             |
| Admin                | ✅             | ✅             | ✅           | ✅             | ✅                 | ✅           | ✅                         | ✅             |

<Note>
  If you are a global Izanami admin or admin of the project's tenant you are
  considered project admin
</Note>

## Tags

Tags allow to regrouping features from different projects of the same tenant.

One feature can have many tags.

Unlike projects and tenants, there is no right associated with tags.
In fact, when visualizing features for a tag, each feature associated with the project right determines if it should be displayed.
