Izanami provides three ways to organize your features.

- Tenant: Izanami is multi-tenant, therefore one instance can be used for completely different use cases
- Projects: inside one tenant, features are distributed in projects
- Tags: tags can regroup features related to the same topic across projects

<TenantProjectTags width="100%" height="500" />

## Tenants

Tenants separate unrelated stuff.

It could, for instance, be used to separate organizations / companies on one Izanami instance.

Users are shared between tenants, project, features and tags are not.

## Projects

Project is a feature container.

It has two main usages:

- group together features related to the same project, topic or software
- manage rights or permissions on this group


## Tags

Tags allow to regrouping features from different projects of the same tenant.

One feature can have many tags.

Unlike projects and tenants, there is no right associated with tags.
In fact, when visualizing features for a tag, each feature associated with the project right determines if it should be displayed.
