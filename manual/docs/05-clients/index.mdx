title: Clients
---

For now, Izanami only supports [Java client](./01-java/index.mdx).

We plan to add support for Javascript (node / in browser client).

If you need another client, don't hesitate to <a href="TODO">open an issue</a> or come discuss it <a href="TODO">on discord</a>, we would be happy to help you with it.

## Why do I need a client ?

It's perfectly correct to call Izanami directly through HTTP. However, a specific client can take care of some boring stuff for you.

- **Cache** : caching feature state can be useful to avoid making too many requests.
- **Local evaluation** : instead of caching feature activation status at a given time, clients can cache feature activation strategy to recompute activation status locally.
- **Resilience** : client can offer several resilience mechanisms to increase your application resilience, such as fallback on previous state or default value.
