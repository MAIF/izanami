import { Note } from "@site/src/components/Note";

Client put features in cache with their activation conditions (or alternative values for string/number features).

This means that (except for script features) client can **compute feature value locally**, without the need to perform an http call to remote Izanami.
In this mode, feature activation conditions/alternative values are **updated periodically in background**.

<Note>
  Script features can't be evaluated locally, since client does not embed a WASM
  runtime.
</Note>

```java
IzanamiClient client = IzanamiClient.newBuilder(
    connectionInformation()
      .withUrl(<REMOTE_IZANAMI_BASE_URL>/api)
      .withClientId(<YOUR_KEY_CLIENT_ID>)
      .withClientSecret(<YOUR_KEY_CLIENT_SECRET>)
  ).withCacheConfiguration(
    FeatureCacheConfiguration
      .newBuilder()
      .enabled(true) // Enable caching feature activation conditions and local activation computation
      .withRefreshInterval(Duration.ofMinutes(5L)) // Optional : how frequently cache will be refreshed
      .build()
  ).build();
```

By default, cache is disabled and a query is sent to remote Izanami for each request.

When cache is active, it's always possible to skip it for some queries :

```java
CompletableFuture<Boolean> result = client.booleanValue(
    newSingleFeatureRequest(id)
    .ignoreCache(true) // Ignore cache and perform request for this query
);

CompletableFuture<Boolean> another = client.booleanValue(
  newFeatureRequest()
    .withFeatures(<FEATURE_IDS>)
    .ignoreCache(true) // Ignore cache and perform request for this query
);
```

<Note>
  Ignoring cache this way will still update cache with retrieved activation
  conditions.
