## What is Open Feature

> OpenFeature is an open specification that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API
> for feature flagging that works with your favorite feature flag management tool or in-house solution.

## Open Feature Java client

Izanami client offers a dedicated Open Feature provider.

To use it, you'll have to configure your client as described in previous pages, and to wrap it in
the provider:

```java
IzanamiClient client = /* instantiate and configure your client here */

IzanamiOpenFeatureProvider openFeatureProvider = new IzanamiOpenFeatureProvider(client);
```

With this provider, you'll be able to use classical open features methods, `user` is passed through Open Feature
`targetingKey`, context must be passed in Open Feature Context with `context` key.


```java
ProviderEvaluation<Boolean> result = openFeatureProvider.getBooleanEvaluation(
  "<YOUR FEATURE ID>",
  false, // default value
  new ImmutableContext("<YOUR USER>", Map.of("context", "<YOUR CONTEXT>"))
);
```

<Note>
Since Open Feature requires passing a default value to perform evaluation, this default value will always be use if evaluation fails / feature is not found.
This will happen even if your client is configured to use a different error strategy.
</Note>

## To be continued

Izanami Open Feature implementation is quite basic right now (it implements "MUST" sections of the Open Feature specifications, but few of the others).

It'll be improved in the future, if you have any specific need or want to contribue, please [open an issue to discuss it](https://github.com/MAIF/izanami/issues).
