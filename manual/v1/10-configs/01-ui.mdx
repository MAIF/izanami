You can access to the configurations clicking "configurations" on the left menu.

![All config](/v1/img/configs/all.png)

You can then

- Search using a pattern on configuration keys
- add a configuration
- update a configuration
- delete a configuration

If you're admin, you can also

- Download configurations

## Edit a configuration

Add or Update a config is really simple. Configs are just key / value pairs where the value is a regular json (text, number, array or object).

![Edit config](/v1/img/configs/editconfig.png)

## Evaluate configs

You can evaluate configs as a tree using the explorer :

![Explorer](/v1/img/configs/explorer.png)

In this example, we've search configs filtering on pattern `*first*`. The results is tree where key are expended and configs are merge in a json object.

## Download and Upload

If you're admin you have the right to download or upload.
