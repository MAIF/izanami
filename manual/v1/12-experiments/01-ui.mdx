You can access to the experiments clicking "experiments" on the left menu.

<img src={all} width="100%" />

You can then

- Search using a pattern on experiment key
- add a experiment
- update a experiment
- delete a experiment

If you're admin, you can also

- Download experiments

## Edit a experiment

Add or Update an experiment is really simple on the UI.

<img src={experiment} width="80%" />

## Evaluate experiments

The explorer allows you to find which variant is associated to a user:

<img src={explorer} width="100%" />

In this example, we've search experiments filtering on pattern `izanami:*` and for the user `ragnar.lodbrock@gmail.com`.

The variant associated to this user is the A variant.

## Consult the results

You can consult which is the winning variant clicking the `See report` button.

<img src={results} width="100%" />

## Download and Upload

If you're admin you have the right to download or upload.

Because experiments are stored into multiple buckets, there is 3 files to download or upload to get all the datas.
