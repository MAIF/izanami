# Philosophy

Every OSS product build at <a href="https://www.maif.fr/" target="_blank">MAIF</a> like <a href="https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/" target="_blank">Otoroshi</a> follow a common philosophy.

- The services or API provided should be technology agnostic.
- HTTP first: HTTP is the right answer to the previous quote
- API First: The UI is just another client of the API.
- Secured: The services exposed need authentication for both humans and machines
- Event based: The services should expose a way to get notified of what happened inside.
