import lock from "@site/static/v1/img/features/lock.png";

With _Lock_, a tree structure can be frozen. The idea is to place locks on nodes to freeze certain branches of tree and allow only the modification of nodes / leaves upstream of the locks.

When a node is locked :

- certain features can be created upstream of the lock
- the creation is forbidden downstream of the lock
- the lock has no effect in another branch of tree

Lock and _authorized patterns_ ( [cf. UI guide ](../ui#edit-a-user) ) does not have a same target :

- lock : freeze a part of tree. All the features can be changed but the creation of new branch can be forbidden.
- authorized patterns : grant permissions (CRUD) to features,

## UI

[Tree mode](./ui#tree-mode) must be used to manage locks. And only **admin** user can add / remove lock.

## Example

Let's go for a schema :

<img src={lock} width="25%" />

This tree is a representation of 2 features :

- a:b:c
- a:b1

A lock is activated on the **b** :

- a feature can be created from **b**, **c**, because **b**, **c** is upstream or equals of **b**
- a feature can't be created from **a**, because **a** is downstream to **b**
- **b** can be deleted / moved
- a lock has no effect on **b1**, because it's not a same branch
